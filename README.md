## Introduction

This repository is part of the [Learn How to use Context and Reducer Hooks in React.js by Creating a Global Snackbar](https://blog.kunalkeshan.dev/learn-how-to-use-context-and-reducer-hooks-in-reactjs-by-creating-a-global-snackbar) article and illustrates the following.

- Setting up an React.js + TypeScript App using Vite.
- Using the `createContext` and `useContext` hooks.
- Using the `useReducer` hook.
- Using the implementation to create a Global Snackbar.

The idea is understand how Context and Reducer Hooks can be used in a combination to create your own Global State management System to avoid issues like Prop Drilling.

This project creates a very raw implementation of a snackbar using only the hooks and no external libraries.
